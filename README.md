## info

Tasks from Vilnius University - Software Engineering - Procedural Programming

All tasks are mostly correct and should include their task at the top of the cpp file. Only `practicals/p04` and `practicals/p05-exam` do not include their task since they were too long.

C++20 is being used to develop in the project, although I don't think any C++20 features were used.

## hw/

This directory includes all the homeworks for the semester. Each directory here may contain more than one question and questions are arranged in the order they were in the word document.

## practicals/

This directory includes everything other than homeworks that had to be done in-class or was some other special task like the exam or the test exam.
